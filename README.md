## Project Description
Need a way to view an entire employee directory at once so that the user can have quick access to their information? Employee Directory is the application for you! This application allows an employee or manager to view non-sensitive data about other employees. Data about the employee's are as follows: photo of employee, name, email, phone number, and age. The user can filter in the search box by name. Additionally, the user will also be able to click the up/down arrow to filter by name in ascending/descending order. You are now ready to keep track of employee information in an organized manner!  

Below is an example that shows the application's appearance and functionality:

## Home Page

## Installation

## Usage
